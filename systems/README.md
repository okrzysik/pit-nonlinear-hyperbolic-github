The code in this directory is used to generate the numerical results in the paper `Parallel-in-time solution of hyperbolic PDE systems via characteristic-variable block preconditioning`

* `acoustics/` implements numerical results for the acoustics equation
* `nonlinear-systems/` implements numerical results for the shallow-water equations and the Euler equations

Further instructions on running specific numerical examples from the paper are given in the `README` files in each of the above directories
