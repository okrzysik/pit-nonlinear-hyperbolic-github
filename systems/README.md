The code in this directory is used to generate the numerical results in the paper `Parallel-in-time solution of hyperbolic PDE systems via characteristic-variable block preconditioning`

* `acoustics/` implements numerical results for the acoustics equation. That is, Figures 1 and 2, and SM Figure 1.
* `nonlinear-systems/` implements numerical results for the shallow-water equations and the Euler equations. That is, Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6, and SM Figures 2, 3, 4, 5.

Further instructions on running specific numerical examples from the paper are given in the `README` files in each of the above directories
